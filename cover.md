### Description

Shopping list application is an good starter to build a 2 tier microservice application and deploy it on any platforms like Kubernetes and OpenShift. The application consists of an **Redis Database**  and **Node.js using Express** backend.

### Architecture

![architecture](_images/arch.png)


This application consists of an Redis database and a Node.js backend and frontend. Combining these technologies, one can build a full-stack web application with CRUD operations. 

**Stack Components:**

1. **Redis DB ([Redis Operator]**

    

   **Why use Redis?**  

   

2. **Express (Back-End Framework)**

   It is a web application framework for Node.js. Being a free and open software, it is used for building web applications and specially APIs. Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that you already know.

   **Why use Express?**

   - Provides a robust set of features for both web and mobile applications
   - Makes back-end code easier and simpler to write.
   - Supports many middleware.
   - Minimal and Flexible web application framework.
   - Creating efficient and robust API is quick and easy.
   - Allows you to define an error handling middleware.

3. **Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment)**

   Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine for developing server-side and networking applications. Being an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, it is used to build fast and scalable network applications. Node.js is free and open source server environment that runs on many platforms.

   **Why Node.js?**

   - Provides event-driven and asynchronous features which makes it lightweight and efficient.
   - No buffering and thus, is very fast.
   - Highly Scalable.
   - Highly extensible.
   - Provides advantage of caching.
   - Handles thousands of concurrent connections with a single server.
   - Provides vast number of libraries.
